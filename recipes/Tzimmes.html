		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			If you haven't tried tzimmes—an Ashkenazi Jewish stew typically made with
			carrots and dried fruit—it's time you met. Tzimmes is traditionally served
			for Rosh Hashanah and Passover, though of course it's a delicious
			vegetable side dish that anyone can enjoy. It pairs perfectly with classic
			brisket and potato kugel.
		</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>3/4 c. orange juice</li>
			<li>1/2 c. water</li>
			<li>1 tbsp. honey</li>
			<li>1 tbsp. brown sugar</li>
			<li>Pinch ground cinnamon</li>
			<li>Pinch kosher salt</li>
			<li>Pinch freshly ground black pepper</li>
			<li>1 tbsp. butter</li>
			<li>1 1/4 lb. carrots, peeled and cut crosswise into 1/2" rounds</li>
			<li>4 large dates, pitted and quartered</li>
			<li>1 tbsp. freshly chopped parsley</li>
			<li>Pinch flaky sea salt</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				In a medium-size bowl, whisk together the orange juice, water, honey,
				brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, and pepper.
			</li>
			<li>
				In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the carrots
				and dates, and toss to coat. Increase the heat medium-high and add the
				orange juice mixture. Cook until the liquid is fully reduced and syrupy,
				about 8 minutes. Poke a carrot with a fork to make sure it’s tender all
				the way through. (If the carrots need more time add another ¼ cup of
				water and keep cooking until liquid is syrupy.)
			</li>
			<li>
				Once the carrots are fork-tender remove the pan from the heat, add the
				parsley and flaky salt, and serve hot.
			</li>
		</ol>
