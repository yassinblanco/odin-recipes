		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			We love an easy oven baked salmon recipe. It takes very little effort and
			is a quick weeknight dinner that's also good enough to serve at a dinner
			party. This citrus salmon has tons of flavor from simple ingredients. Here
			we used oranges and limes, but use lemons, grapefruits, or blood oranges
			if you have them. If you like things a little spicier, leave the seeds in
			the jalapeño. As the salmon bakes the juices start to turn into a syrupy
			sauce thanks to the honey and creates a perfect glaze over the salmon.
